# The Phoenix Project: A Novel about IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win

## Chapter 1: Tuesday, September 2 

- Bill Palmer, the Director of Midrange Technology Operations, is the protagonist, and he is responsible for the "availability and smooth functioning of a relatively small IT group at Parts Unlimited" (15).
- He refers to his chosen turf as the "technology backwaters" (15).
- Bill Palmer is seemingly frustrated with his role. After hearing an ad on the radio from a competing business, Palmer thinks to himself 
> "The ad is brilliant. I'd use the service in a second, if I weren't such a loyal company man...When our Marketing people hear this ad, they'll go ballistic. Because they're likely art or music majors, not people with a technology background, they'll publically promise the impossible and IT will have to figure out how to deliver" (16). 
	As well, after visiting his company's HR office at the request of HR's VP and noticing the office's wood paneling, he thinks to himself "Suddenly, the pain and carpet in my building seeem decades overdue for replacement. That's IT lot in life. At least, we're not in a dingy, dimly lit dank basement, like in the Brisith TV show, *The IT Crowd*" (17).
- Working in his field at his specific company is difficult because "We have to do more with less, to simultaneously maintain competitiveness and reduce costs. Some days, I think that it can't be done"(16).
- Bill is offered the role of VP of IT Operations. He initially, and for most of the chapters, refuses the offer. CIO, in Bill's mind, stands for "Career Is Over" (18), and it goes against what he thinks is the "trick" to a long career in IT Management, which is "to get enough seniority to get good things done but to keep your head low enough to avoid political battles that make you inherently vulnerable" (18). 
- Bill meets with Steve Masters, the current CEO and acting CIO of Parts Unlimited, and Bill emphazises the importance of an initative called "Project Phoenix."Project Phoenix is one that will allow them to be competitive and profitable again by allowing customers to purchase their products wherever they are, "wheter it's on the Internet or in our retail stores" (21). 
- Steve's job is not the only one on the line, but potentiall thousands of others as "there's a vocal group of shareholders trying to split up the company" (21). 
- Two quotations from Bills that stands out during his conversation with Steve. 
> You want IT systesmt obe reliable and availalbe, and for the business to be able to depend upon them. You want disruptions to normal operations kept to an absolute minumum so that the business can focus on getting Phoenix done (23).
> Restore critical business operations and keep us out of the front-page news. Got. Thanks(24). 
- This last quote from Bill is descirbed as occuring automatically. Bill either knows his role really well or knows how to talk to senior leadership. 
- Bill isn't clear why he's thanking Steve at the conclusion of the chapter.
